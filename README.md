<p>Full Stack Developer specializing in web and mobile application development, with a strong focus on Flutter and Dart - my core technologies and areas of expertise and passion. I have extensive experience in native Android development using Java and cross-platform development with Flutter. Proficient in database systems such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL, I have also worked with frameworks like Spring (Java) and Vue.js. Additionally, I possess hands-on experience with blockchain technologies including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and the Cosmos Network. I led the development of tarBUS, an app downloaded over 10,000 times on iOS and Android, serving a growing community for approximately three years.</p>
