### Hey there, I'm Dominik <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" height="25px" width="25px"> a Full Stack Developer with a 4-year track record of excellence in Flutter (Android & iOS) development.

I am a Full Stack Developer with a focus on web and mobile app development, particularly using Flutter and Dart, which are my core technologies and areas of passion. I have experience in native Android development with Java, as well as cross-platform development using Flutter. I'm proficient in database systems such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL, and have worked with frameworks like Spring (Java) and Vue.js. I have practical experience with blockchain technologies including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and the Cosmos Network.

In the past, I led the development of tarBUS, an app that was downloaded over 10,000 times on iOS and Android, serving a growing community for about three years. My passion extends to open-sourcing and leveraging technology for social good.

                <h3>KIRA Blockchain Explorer (miro)</h3>
                <p>As a frontend developer (Flutter), I contributed to the Miro project, a Blockchain Explorer for the Kira Network. This tool was designed to provide transparent and real-time insights into transactions, blocks, and validators within the Kira Network. Miro stood out for its ability to navigate the complex data of a decentralized network, offering users an intuitive and comprehensive view of blockchain activities.</p>

                <h3>MIRAGE</h3>
                <p>As a reviewer, I worked on the "Mirage" project. I had the opportunity to support the design of the application from scratch and assist in integrating processes between SNGGLE and MRUMRU using the "cryptography_utils" and "codec_utils" packages. Mirage is an application that serves as a bridge between SNGGLE and the outside world, enabling the offline app to connect to Metamask via sound.</p>

                <p>I contributed to the "mrumru" project by consulting the progress with a PhD specializing in sound and summarizing the acquired knowledge through project management, planning, breaking the project into smaller tasks, and reviewing the code produced by collaborators. Mrumru is an audio transmission protocol protocol that enables the transmission of any data using sound, which makes safe and convenient way to interact with the world while remaining fully offline.</p>
